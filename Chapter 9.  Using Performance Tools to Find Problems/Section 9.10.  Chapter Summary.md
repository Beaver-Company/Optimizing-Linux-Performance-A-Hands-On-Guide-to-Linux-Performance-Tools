### 9.10\. Chapter Summary

This chapter provided a method for using the Linux performance tools together to track down different types of performance problems. Although it is not possible to capture every type of performance problem that could go wrong, this methodology helps you find some of the more common problems. In addition, if the problem that you face is not covered here, the data that you collect will still be useful because it might open up different areas of investigation.

The next few chapters show this method being used to find performance problems on a Linux system.

This chapter presented the Linux disk I/O performance tools used to extract information about system-wide (<tt>vmstat</tt>), device-specific (<tt>vmstat</tt>, <tt>iostat</tt>, <tt>sar</tt>), and file-specific (<tt>lsof</tt>) disk I/O usage. It explained the different types of I/O statistics and how to extract these statistics from Linux using the I/O performance tools. It also discussed some of the significant limitations of the current tools and areas for future growth.

The next chapter examines the tools that enable you to determine the cause of network bottlenecks.

### 3.3\. Chapter Summary

This chapter focused on system-wide memory performance metrics. These metrics mainly demonstrate how the operating system is using memory rather than a particular application.

This chapter demonstrated how performance tools such as <tt>sar</tt> and <tt>vmstat</tt> can be used to extract this system-wide memory performance information from a running system. The output of these tools indicates how the system as a whole is using available memory. The next chapter describes the tools available to investigate a single process's CPU usage.
